#Pip
##About pip
Pip is the python package manager, you will be able to get specific packages used for use with the system or to help development. Once you installed you will have access to all the wonderful modules and libraries provided to Python users via [PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi). 

There is a great [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/index.html) install script that installs the manager and required dependencies for us. It can be downloaded through PyPI.
```
wget https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py
python get-pip.py
```

On systems with the apt package manager it can be installed via the standard command.
`sudo apt-get install python-pip`
